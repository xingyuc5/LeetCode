# 437. Path Sum III
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/)

## Description

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

**Example:**

```
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```



## Thoughts

Difference from path sum 1: 

- Path does not need to start from root nor need to end at leaf.
- As long as a path is going down from parent to child, it is a valid path.
- Return number of such paths but not the exact paths.



Idea: 

- Starts to form path from each node?
- Path consider found at any node as long as the number sums to required value
- Count the number of paths
