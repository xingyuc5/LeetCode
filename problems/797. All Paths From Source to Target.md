# 797. All Paths From Source to Target
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/)

## Description

Given a directed, acyclic graph of `N` nodes. Find all possible paths from node `0` to node `N-1`, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1. graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists.

```
Example:
Input: [[1,2], [3], [3], []] 
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] 
Explanation: The graph looks like this:
0--->1
|    |
v    v
2--->3
There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
```

**Note:**

- The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range `[2, 15]`.
- You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of nodes inside one path.



## Thoughts

Given the graph is directed and acyclic, there is no loop and no turning around in the traversal of nodes, hence, simply apply dfs to the graph, starting from src node to form path, and goal test would be checking if the last node of a path is the dest node, if so add the path into results and return, otherwise, continue dfs .

        self.dfs(graph, paths, [0])
