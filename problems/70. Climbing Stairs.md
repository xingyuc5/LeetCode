# 70. Climbing Stairs
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

## Description

You are climbing a stair case. It takes *n* steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 45`



## Thoughts

Solve using Dynamic Programming

`state[n] = state[n-1] + state[n-2]`
