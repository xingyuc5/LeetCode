# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

## Description

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

Given binary search tree: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.

## Thoughts

LCA: Least Common Ancestor Node of two different nodes. Since nodes are unique, a LCA of two nodes means one node is in the left subtree of LCA and the other is in the right subtree of the LCA, which means one node is greater than LCA and the other is smaller than LCA. Special case exists, such that one node is its LCA with other, therefore, conditions should be greater or equals/smaller or equals to take this special case into consideration.
