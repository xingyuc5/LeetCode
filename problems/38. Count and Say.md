# 38. Count and Say
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

## Description

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n* where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 30, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
```

## Thoughts

Idea:  Each string can be seen as a number of groups of repeating number letters. 

T(5): (111)(22)(1)

We have 3 '1', 2 '2' and 1 '1'

Therefore T(6) would be 312211

```

Base case: 1

Transition from T(n) to T(n+1):

Iterate through the string:

	count number of letters in each group and compute new string 


Function: 
T(1): return 1
T(n): apply transition function to string for n-1 times

1
11
21


group 2
counter 1
```
