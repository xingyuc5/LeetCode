# 28. Implement strStr()
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)

## Description

Implement [strStr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or **-1** if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

**Clarification:**

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's [strstr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/) and Java's [indexOf()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf(java.lang.String)).

## Thoughts

Simple: Sliding window method. Iterate through the haystack and compare the needle against it

Time complexity: O(nm)

Space complexity: O(1) 

Pseudocode:

```
s ← 0 
while s ≤ n−m 
	for i ← 0 to m−1 
		if T[s + i] != P[i] 
			break 
     if i = m 
     	return s 
     s ← s + 1 
return not found
```











More advanced: KMP algorithm.

Time complexity: O(2n+m)

Space complexity: O(m)
