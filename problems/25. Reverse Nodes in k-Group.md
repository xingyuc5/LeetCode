# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/)



## Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return *the modified list*.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

 

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?



## Thoughts

1. Recursive helper function: reverse between two nodes
2. Recursion
   1. Base case: 
      1. empty list -> return null	
      2. Remaining nodes < k -> return head
   2. Recursive case:
      - Given head as start of group, find end of group
      - reverse this group
      - link end of this group to start of next group
