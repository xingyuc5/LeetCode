# 206. Reverse Linked List
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

## Description

Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example:**

```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```

**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?



## Thoughts

Traverse the list and set the next pointer of each node to the previous node in the original list.

# Iterative



# Definition for singly-linked list.

#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        
        curr = head
        prev = None
        
        # traverse list and set the next pointer of each as the previous node
        while curr:
            
            tmp = curr.next  # tmp to store original next node of current node
            curr.next = prev # update next node of current node to prev
            prev = curr      # keep track of prev, current node would become prev in the next iteration
