# 2. Add Two Numbers

[Link to Question]()

## Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## Thoughts

Main idea: Iterate both lists together, sum them and update node.
Careful with:

1. Which list ends first
2. How is the carrybit being carried forward?
   - What happend when 1+99999
   - Extra node required, so remember to malloc it
3. Must iterate through the end of longer list
4. Remember to connect nodes:
   - If choose l1 as result list and update nodes in l1, then we should connect the end of l1 to the rest of l2.

Space complexity: O(1)

- Constant number of pointers used and malloc a extra node if needed
  Time complexity: O(n)
- Iterate through the lists from head to foot

```C
struct ListNode* addTwoNumbers(struct ListNode* l1, struct ListNode* l2) {
    // Base case
    if (!l1) {
        return l2;
    }
    if (!l2) {
        return l1;
    }

    // Normal case
    struct ListNode* prev;
    struct ListNode* curr1 = l1;
    struct ListNode* curr2 = l2;
    int carryBit = 0;

    while (curr1 && curr2) {
        prev = curr1;
        // Sum two nodes and carrybit
        int sum = curr1->val + curr2->val + carryBit;

        // If equals or greater than 10, carry forward
        if (sum >= 10) {
            curr1->val = sum - 10;
            carryBit = 1;
        } else {
            curr1->val = sum;
            carryBit = 0;
        }

        // Proceed to next node
        curr1 = curr1->next;
        curr2 = curr2->next;
    }
    struct ListNode* rest;
    // If l1 is shorter than l2
    if (curr2) {
        prev->next = curr2;
        rest = curr2;
    } else if (curr1) {
        rest = curr1;
    }

    // While carrybit is non-0
    while (carryBit && rest) {
        prev = rest;

        // Update node and carryBit
        if (rest->val + carryBit == 10) {
            rest->val = 0;
        } else {
            rest->val += carryBit;
            carryBit = 0;
        }
        rest = rest->next;
    }

    // If the list ends and carry bit is still 1, add a new node
    if (carryBit) {
        struct ListNode* newNode = malloc(sizeof(struct ListNode));
        newNode->val = 1;
        newNode->next = NULL;
        prev->next = newNode;
    }

    return l1;
}
