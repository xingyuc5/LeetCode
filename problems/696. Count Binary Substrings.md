# 696. Count Binary Substrings

[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/submissions/)

## Description

Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

Example 1:

```
Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
```

Note:

s.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
s will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.

## Thoughts

- **Aim:** Count the number of substrings which has equal number of **consecutive** 0s and 1s.

- **Requirement:** O(n) time complexity, O(1) space complexity.

Idea:

> Iterate the string and accumulate total counts.
> When will the counts increase:
>
> 1. character changed. (i.e. '0' changed to '1' or vice versa)
> 2. Length of current consecutive substring is smaller or equal to last consecutive substring
>
> - Example: Given string "000111",
> - First increment: index=3, letter chaned from '0' to '1'
> - Second increment: index=4, length of current consecutive substring = 2, length of last consecutive substring = 3
> - Third increment: index=5, length of current consecutive substring = 3, length of last consecutive substring = 3
> - Nullbyte '0' is reached, loop terminated and return total count of 3 as result.
>
> To achive this idea, we need 4 variables.
>
> - counts: Keep track of total number of qualified substrings
> - currentStreak: Keep track of which letter the current consecutive subtstring is made of
>   - For example: Given string "0001111", currentStreak is '0' for [0,2] and '1' for [3,6]
> - lastConsecutiveCounts: Keep track of how many letters the last consecutive string has
> - curretnConsecutiveCounts: Keep track of how many letters the current consecutive string has
