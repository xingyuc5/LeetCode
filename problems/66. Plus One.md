# 66. Plus One
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)

## Description

Given a **non-empty** array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
```

## Thoughts

Iterate the array/list from the end, add 1 to each digit and check if the result equals to 10. 

If the result equals to 10, change the current digit to 0 and set carryBit as true.

If the result is less than 10, increase the current digit by 1 and return the array, since the other more significant digits would no longer change.

If after the termination of loops, and carryBit is still true, we must create a new list with one extra slot for the leading 1.

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n) worst case
