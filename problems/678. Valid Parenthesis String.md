# 678. Valid Parenthesis String

[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string/)

## Description

Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '\*', write a function to check whether this string is valid. We define the validity of a string by these rules:

1. Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
2. Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
3. Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
4. '\*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string.
5. An empty string is also valid.

Example 1:

```
Input: "()"
Output: True
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "(*)"
Output: True
```

Example 3:

```
Input: "(*))"
Output: True
```

Note:

- The string size will be in the range [1, 100].

## Thoughts

1. Iterate the string in forward direction, count the occurences of `(`, `)` and `*`. Whenever the combined counts of `(` and `*` is smaller than `)`, it means that there is an extra `)` at the left which is not valid. Therefore return false.

2. Iterate string in backward direction, do the similar thing to count if there is any extra `(` at the left that has no `*` to compensate for it.

3. If function not returned in the two while loops, return true as none of the rules are broken.
