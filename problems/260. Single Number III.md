# 260. Single Number III
[Link to Question]()

## Description

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

**Example:**

```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```

**Note**:

1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.

2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

        a = 0
        for num in nums:
            a ^= num
        # the result after iteration is the xor of x and y, where x and y are the only single numbers
        # the other numbers appear twice and would cancel each other by xor themself
        
        # The following method is adapted from solution:
        # find the rightmost bit which x and y differs
        rightmost = a & (-a)
        
        # use the rightmost bit to find x, which is the number that has 1 on the same
        # bit of the rightmost 1 of the previous result
        x = 0
        for num in nums:
            # only xor the numbers that has 1 on the same bit of rightmost bit
            # which means y would not be xored in the iteration
            # the other numbers which also have 1 on the same bit of rightmost bit would
            # eventually cancel out, leaving x as the result of this iteration
            if rightmost & num:
                x ^= num
        
        # use a, the result of xoring all numbers to xor x (cancel x), therefore, yielding
        # the other single number y
        return [x, a^x]
        # O(2N)=O(N) time complexity
        # O(3)=O(1) space complexity
