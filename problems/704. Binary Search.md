# 704. Binary Search

[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

## Description

Given a sorted (in ascending order) integer array nums of n elements and a target value, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index, otherwise return -1.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

Note:

1. You may assume that all elements in nums are unique.
2. n will be in the range [1, 10000].
3. The value of each element in nums will be in the range [-9999, 9999].

## Thoughts

Classic binary search algorithm for sorted array

Idea:

```

While the search space is non-empty:
    Select the center element in the array and compare with key
        if match, return its index

        else, eliminate the impossible candidates:
            if center element is smaller than key, then all elements left to the center element are smaller than key, no point to search our key among these, the other case is similar.

If the function returns before loop terminated, good, we found a matched key and returns its index

If no candidate matched the key, the loop will terminate when the search space is empty, so we return -1 in the end.
```

        } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
