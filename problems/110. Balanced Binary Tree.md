# 110. Balanced Binary Tree
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

## Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

> a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of *every* node differ in height by no more than 1.

 

**Example 1:**

Given the following tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Return true.

**Example 2:**

Given the following tree `[1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]`:

```
       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
```

Return false.

## Thoughts

Aim: Validate if a tree is balanced by heights: left and right subtrees of every node has a difference in height of no more than 1 (0 or 1).



Idea: (Top-Down recursion)

Condition for a given tree to be **height balanced**

- Its left subtree is balanced (recursive call of `isBalanced()` function)
- Its right subtree is balanced (recursive call of `isBalanced()` function)
- Heights of its left and right subtrees do not differ more than 1 (helper function `height()` to compute height of a node)



Time complexity: O(nlogn)

Space complexity: O(n)





**Solution from LeetCode**: Bottom-Up recursion **without** helper class

Idea: Only need to recursively traverse the tree once in the helper function `helper()`, compute the height of subtrees of nodes and compare their values, two subtrees have heights which differ more than 1, return a value `-1` indicating parent node is not balanced. Therefore, for each node, if its left or right subtree has height of -1, returns -1 immediately as the whole tree would be unbalanced when any of the subtrees is unbalanced. Finally, check if the return value after invoking `helper() ` function is -1 in the original function.











Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n)
