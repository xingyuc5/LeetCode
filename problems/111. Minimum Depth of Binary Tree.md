# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## Description

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its minimum depth = 2.



## Thoughts

BFS to search for a node with no children layer by layer, and return the depth of such node.
