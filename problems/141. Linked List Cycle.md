# 141. Linked List Cycle

[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

## Description

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

## Thoughts

My Idea: Iterate through the list and add each node into a set. If the node in current iteration is already in the set, return true, there is a cycle. If the list reaches the end, return false. O(n) space and time complexity

Official solution: use fast and slow pointers. O(1) space complexity

Other solution: Iterate through the list and change each node value to some special values, if the node in current iteration has such value, then the list has cycle. O(1) space complexity but changes the list

## Solution

Languages:

- [C](#C)
- [Python](#python)
- [Java](#java)

<div id="C"></div>C Code:

```C
// Official solution
// O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
bool hasCycle(struct ListNode* head) {
    if (!head || !head->next) {
        return false;
    }

    struct ListNode* slow = head;
    struct ListNode* fast = head;

    while (fast && fast->next) {
        fast = fast->next->next;
        slow = slow->next;

        if (fast == slow) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

<div id="java"></div>Java Code:

```java
// O(n) space and time complexity
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        Set<ListNode> set = new HashSet();

        while (head != null) {
            if (set.contains(head)) {
                return true;
            }
            set.add(head);
            head = head.next;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
