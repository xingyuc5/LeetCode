[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## Description

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its depth = 3.
