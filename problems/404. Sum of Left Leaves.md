# 404. Sum of Left Leaves
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-left-leaves/)

## Description

Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.

**Example:**

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. Return 24.
```



## Thoughts

How to determine if a node is a left leaf?

- Left: It must be the left child of its parent 
    - Keep tracks of which node it comes from
- Leaf: It has no children
    - Checks `node.left` and `node.right` are both empty
