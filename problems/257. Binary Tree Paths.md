# 257. Binary Tree Paths
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)

## Description

Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

```
Input:

   1
 /   \
2     3
 \
  5

Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]

Explanation: All root-to-leaf paths are: 1->2->5, 1->3
```



## Thoughts

DFS: form path when a leaf node is reached and add into results
