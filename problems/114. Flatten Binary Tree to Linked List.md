# 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

## Description

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```

The flattened tree should look like:

```
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```



## Thoughts

- For each node:
    - set the `right child of node` to be the `right child` of the `rightmost leaf of the left subtree of node`
    - set the left child to become right child of node
    - set left child of node to `null`
