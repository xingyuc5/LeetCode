# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)

## Description

On a staircase, the `i`-th step has some non-negative cost `cost[i]` assigned (0 indexed).

Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
Output: 15
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the top.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
```



**Note:**

1. `cost` will have a length in the range `[2, 1000]`.

2. Every `cost[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 999]`.

        a = 0
        b = min(cost[0], cost[1])
        
        # this problem has the perfect sub-structure property
        # i.e. the minimum cost to go from u to v + minimum cost to go from v to w, equals to minimum cost to go from u to w
        # stair index 2 can be reached from stair index 0 by 2 staris with a cost of cost[0]
        # on the other hand, it can be reached from stair index 1 by 1 stair with a cost of cost[1]
        # therefore the minimum cost to reach stair index 2 can be computed directly 
        
        # populate the list
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            t = b
            b = min(b+cost[i-1], a+cost[i-2])
            a = t
        
        # return total cost
