# 987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree/)

## Description

Given a binary tree, return the *vertical order* traversal of its nodes values.

For each node at position `(X, Y)`, its left and right children respectively will be at positions `(X-1, Y-1)` and `(X+1, Y-1)`.

Running a vertical line from `X = -infinity` to `X = +infinity`, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing `Y` coordinates).

If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.

Return an list of non-empty reports in order of `X` coordinate. Every report will have a list of values of nodes.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/31/1236_example_1.PNG)

```
Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation: 
Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/31/tree2.png)**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation: 
The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
However, in the report "[1,5,6]", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.
```

 

**Note:**

1. The tree will have between 1 and `1000` nodes.

2. Each node's value will be between `0` and `1000`.

    

## Thoughts

1. Use dfs to compute coordinates of each node and store them
2. Sort the nodes based on smallest x, largest y and smallest value first and add values into results
