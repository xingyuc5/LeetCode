# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

## Description

Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3
```

Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

## Thoughts

> Idea: Divide and Conquer
> A tree is made up of left subtree, root, rightsubtree
> The k-th smallest number is in one of these three.
> Traversal: Pre-order traversal which visit nodes in order of > their values.
> Since we need the kth smallest value, we need to keep track of > how many number we have visited in order to find the kth smallest one.

Psudocode:

```
func(root, k):
   if root:
      func(root->left, k)
      k-=1
      if k -- 0:
         return root.val
      func(root->right, k)


   return





         5
        / \
       3   6
      / \
     2   4
    /
   1
```
