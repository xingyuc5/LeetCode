# 814. Binary Tree Pruning

[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/)

## Description

We are given the head node `root` of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

```
Example 1:
Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
 
Explanation: 
Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
The diagram on the right represents the answer.
Example 2:
Input: [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,1,null,1]
Example 3:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]
Output: [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]
```

**Note:**

- The binary tree will have at most `100 nodes`.
- The value of each node will only be `0` or `1`.
