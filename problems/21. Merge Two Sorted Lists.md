# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

## Description

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

## Thoughts

Idea:

1. Simplest case: one of the two lists is empty, therefore the resulting list is just the non-empty list. Return it right away.

2. Compare values of head of the two lists, choose the node with smaller value to be the head of `resultList`, the list with smaller value in head will have its head advance to next node. Let a new pointer `curr` point to same node as `resultList`. `resultList` will be used to record the head of final list and be returned while `curr` is used to add more nodes to the final list.

3. Iterate through both lists, compare their head values at each iteration. The node with smaller value would be added to result list, by letting `curr->next` be this node, the list with this smaller value node will advance to next step by `lx=lx->next`. Then we update curr using `curr=curr->next`

4. The `while` loop will terminate when one of the two lists reach the end. We just add the remaining part of non-empty list to the `resultList` and we are done.

```C
struct ListNode* mergeTwoLists(struct ListNode* l1, struct ListNode* l2) {
    struct ListNode *resultList, *curr;

    if (l1 == NULL) {
        resultList = l2;
        return resultList;
    }
    if (l2 == NULL) {
        resultList = l1;
        return resultList;
    }

    if (l1->val < l2->val) {
        resultList = l1;
        l1 = l1->next;
    } else {
        resultList = l2;
        l2 = l2->next;
    }
    curr = resultList;

    while (l1 && l2) {
        if (l1->val < l2->val) {
            curr->next = l1;
            curr = curr->next;
            l1 = l1->next;
        } else {
            curr->next = l2;
            curr = curr->next;
            l2 = l2->next;
        }
    }

    if (l1) {
        curr->next = l1;
    } else {
        curr->next = l2;
    }

    return resultList;
}
