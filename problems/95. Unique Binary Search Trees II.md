# 95. Unique Binary Search Trees II
[Link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/)

## Description

Given an integer *n*, generate all structurally unique **BST's** (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... *n*.

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output:
[
  [1,null,3,2],
  [3,2,null,1],
  [3,1,null,null,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [1,null,2,null,3]
]
Explanation:
The above output corresponds to the 5 unique BST's shown below:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

## Thoughts

Aim: Build all possible BST from a given list/array

Idea: 

- If no numbers given in list, return [None] as this tree does not exist

- Try to start with each number (i) as root node, n choices
  - For each i in list 
    - left subtree would have i-1 numbers, the possible left subtrees can be built in the same manner as we recursively call the build function with updated numbers in list
    - right subtree would have n-i numbers, the possible right subtrees can be built in the same manner as we recursively call the build function with updated numbers in list
    - for each possible leftsubtree
      - for each possible right subtree
        - Let current i be the root node, and its leftsubtree would be currLeft, right subtree would be currRight
        - We therefore concatenate current root node with all possible left and right candidates
  - return the final result
